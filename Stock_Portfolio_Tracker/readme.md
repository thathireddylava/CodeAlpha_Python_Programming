- Stock Portfolio Tracker 
● Goal: Build a simple stock tracker that calculates total investment based on manually defined stock 
prices. 
● Simplified Scope: 
○ User inputs stock names and quantity. 
○ Use a hardcoded dictionary to define stock prices (e.g., {"AAPL": 180, "TSLA": 250}). 
○ Display total investment value and optionally save the result in a .txt or .csv file. 
● Key Concepts Used: dictionary, input/output, basic arithmetic, file handling 
(optional).
